# Secure-Function-Evaluation

The goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of secure multi-party computation by writing a program to perform two-party secure function evaluation using Yao’s garbled- circuit protocol. In particular, I will implement the method described in section 22.2 of Nigel Smart’s Cryptography Made Simple for garbled circuits and the method described in section 20.3 for oblivious transfers (Bellare and Micali with optimisations from Naor and Pinkas).
